# Avalon

Avalon is a Python implementation of the Resistance: Avalon board game with support for **LLM-driven agent players** powered by Google's Gemini API. The game can be played with all humans, all agents, or any mix of both.

## Features

- **Complete Avalon Game Engine**: Team proposals, voting, missions, assassination, all special roles
- **LLM Agent Players**: AI agents powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash that can play strategically
- **Mixed Games**: Seamlessly combine human and agent players
- **YAML Configuration**: Configure games via config files
- **Interactive CLI**: Play via console with hidden prompts for secret decisions
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 97+ tests covering all game mechanics

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. Install Poetry: `pipx install poetry` or follow [Poetry installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
2. Install dependencies: `poetry install`

### Play a Human-Only Game

```bash
poetry run python -m avalon.interaction
```

The CLI will prompt for player count, optional roles, and player names.

### Play with Agent Players

1. Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```
3. Create a config file (or use `config-agents.yaml`):
   ```yaml
   players:
     - name: Alice
       type: human
     - name: BobBot
       type: agent
     - name: CarolBot
       type: agent
     - name: DaveBot
       type: agent
     - name: EveBot
       type: agent
   
   optional_roles:
     - percival
     - morgana
   
   random_seed: 42
   ```
4. Run with the config (choose one):
   
   Using the helper script (recommended):
   ```bash
   poetry run python run_agent_game.py config-agents.yaml
   ```
   
   Or using the main module:
   ```bash
   poetry run python -m avalon.interaction --config config-agents.yaml
   ```

Agents will automatically make decisions with reasoning displayed in the CLI.

## Agent Players

Agent players use Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model to:
- **Propose teams** as mission leaders
- **Vote** on team proposals with strategic reasoning
- **Execute missions** (playing success or fail cards based on alignment)
- **Guess Merlin** in the assassination phase

### How It Works

1. **Observation Building**: Each agent receives filtered game state including:
   - Their role and alignment
   - Role-based knowledge (e.g., Merlin sees evil players)
   - Public game history (votes, mission results)
   - Current phase and mission requirements

2. **LLM Decision-Making**: The agent's observation is serialized into a natural language prompt, sent to Gemini, and the structured JSON response is parsed into game actions.

3. **Validation & Fallback**: Invalid agent responses trigger fallback behaviors or human intervention.

### Configuration

Players can be specified in two formats:

**Simple format** (defaults to human):
```yaml
players:
  - Alice
  - Bob
```

**Structured format** (specify type):
```yaml
players:
  - name: Alice
    type: human
  - name: BobBot
    type: agent
```

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
poetry run pytest                    # Run all tests
poetry run pytest tests/test_agents.py -v  # Run agent tests
```

### Code Quality

```bash
poetry run ruff check .              # Linting
poetry run ruff format .             # Formatting
poetry run mypy src                  # Type checking
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Install pre-commit hooks for automatic checks:
```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

## Implemented Domain Layer

- Enumerations for alignments and role types (`avalon.enums`).
- Role registry with default distributions, validation, and helpers (`avalon.roles`).
- Player model with agent hook placeholder and metadata accessors (`avalon.players`).
- Knowledge packet generator for setup vision (`avalon.knowledge`).
- Mission and game configuration models with official rule validation (`avalon.config`).
- Setup orchestration producing role assignments, player objects, and knowledge briefings (`avalon.setup`).
- Game state finite-state machine covering team proposals, voting, mission resolution, auto-fail handling, scoring, assassination workflow, and mission action/public summary logging (`avalon.game_state`).
- Unit tests covering configuration, setup, and comprehensive game state scenarios.
- Interaction utilities with a prompt-based CLI runner and scripted harness for automated validation (`avalon.interaction`).
- Custom role selection allowing users to choose which optional special characters (Percival, Morgana, Mordred, Oberon) to include, with remaining slots filled by generic servants/minions (`avalon.roles.build_role_list`).
- YAML configuration file support for fully automated game setup without interactive prompts (`avalon.config_loader`).
- Structured event logging primitives (`avalon.events`) captured during state transitions and major outcomes.
- Persistence helpers for snapshotting and restoring game state, including event logs (`avalon.persistence`).

## Interactive CLI

- Run `poetry run python -m avalon.interaction` to play a full game via the console.
- The CLI prompts for player count, optional special character selection, player names, and guides proposals, votes, mission cards, and assassination guesses.
- Alternatively, pass a config file with `poetry run python -m avalon.interaction --config config.yaml` to skip setup prompts and load all configuration from YAML.
- Sensitive decisions (votes and mission cards) are collected using hidden prompts to preserve secrecy at the table.
- Private setup briefings can be tailored via `BriefingOptions` (sequential vs batch, optional readiness/acknowledgement pauses).
- `run_interactive_game` returns an `InteractionResult` bundling the final `GameState` and a transcript of prompts/responses (`InteractionLogEntry`) categorized by `InteractionEventType` (prompt, hidden prompt, output).

## Architecture

### All-Agent Demo

See `demo_agents.py` for a complete example of running a game with 5 agent players using the mock client.

### Custom LLM Client

Implement the `LLMClient` protocol to use different LLM providers:

```python
from avalon.agents import AgentObservation, TeamProposal, VoteDecision
from avalon.agent_manager import LLMClient

class CustomLLMClient:
    def propose_team(self, observation: AgentObservation) -> TeamProposal:
        # Your custom logic here
        ...
    
    def vote_on_team(self, observation: AgentObservation) -> VoteDecision:
        ...
    
    # Implement execute_mission and guess_merlin
```
